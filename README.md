# Video Overlay application

An Angular App which when put together with Facebook and Ffmpeg will allow you to produce videos with faces overlayed upon.

The back-end also provided in the code uses Flight PHP to provide an API for the Angular app to communicate with the server. The back-end will require installation of FFMPEG and ImageMagick. The API also acts as a proxy for communincation with Facebook in certain circumstances.
